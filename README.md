# **Customer Segmentation of Credit Card Users**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using a dataset of credit card users. The goal is to group customers based on their spending behavior and patterns to derive actionable insights. Businesses can use this segmentation to improve customer targeting, optimize resources, and design tailored marketing strategies.

## **Key Objectives**
1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and outliers in the dataset.
2. **Preprocess the data** to prepare it for clustering algorithms.
3. Apply the **DBSCAN clustering algorithm** to identify distinct customer segments.

## **Project Structure**

This repository contains the following files:

1. **`EDA.ipynb`**  
   - Contains the Exploratory Data Analysis process.
   - Visualizes data distribution, trends, and outliers.
   - Provides insights into potential segmentation patterns.

2. **`Preprocessing.ipynb`**  
   - Focuses on cleaning and transforming the raw data.
   - Handles missing values, scales numerical features, and encodes categorical variables.
   - Prepares the dataset for clustering analysis.

3. **`DBSCAN_Clustering.ipynb`**  
   - Implements the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.
   - Evaluates clustering results and visualizes customer groups.
   - Discusses the significance of each segment and its potential business applications.

## **Key Insights**
- Segmented customers into groups based on their credit card usage patterns.
- Identified distinct customer profiles such as high spenders, low spenders, and occasional users.
- DBSCAN effectively handled noise and identified clusters of varying densities.

---

## **Applications**
- Targeted marketing strategies.
- Personalized customer experiences.
- Better allocation of marketing and operational resources.

---

## **Future Work**
- Experiment with other clustering algorithms like K-Means or Agglomerative Clustering.
- Incorporate more features for deeper insights.
- Develop a deployment-ready dashboard to visualize customer segments interactively.
